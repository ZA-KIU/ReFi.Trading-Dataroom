# Risk Mitigation Plan (Regulatory)

- **Licensing Delays:** If the ADGM licensing process is delayed or denied, the company will prioritise a white‑label partnership to enable live trading.
- **Regulatory Changes:** Maintain a legal budget and monitor regulatory developments in each target jurisdiction. The non‑custodial model reduces exposure to many banking regulations.
- **Partner Risk:** Maintain relationships with multiple brokers so that a disruption with one partner does not halt operations.
- **Legal Documentation:** Keep a complete compliance audit trail with timestamps for all policy decisions, licence applications and legal reviews.
