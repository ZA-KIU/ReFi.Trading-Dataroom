# Financial Model Summary

![Financial Metrics Chart](financial-metrics-chart.png)

The financial model projects three years of revenue, costs and cash flow for ReFi.Trading. Key outputs include:

- **Total Projected Value:** US $611 m (NPV).
- **Net Present Value (NPV):** US $611 m at the chosen discount rate.
- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR):** approximately 21 %.
- **Return on Investment (ROI):** around 194 %.

Revenue assumptions depend on converting paper traders into paid subscribers and expanding the user base over three years. Costs include cloud infrastructure, team salaries, compliance/licensing fees, marketing and overhead. The model uses conservative, base and aggressive scenarios to stress‑test projections.
