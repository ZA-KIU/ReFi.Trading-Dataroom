# Key Risks

- **Regulatory Risk:** Failure to obtain a licence in the UAE would delay live trading. Mitigation: pursue a white‑label partnership and diversify licensing across multiple jurisdictions.
- **Technical Risk:** Reinforcement learning agents may underperform in live markets compared with backtests. Mitigation: run extensive paper trading and implement progressive caps and risk limits.
- **Market Risk:** Retail trading volumes may decline during economic downturns. Mitigation: target small funds and professional traders as secondary customer segments.
- **Competition Risk:** Larger brokers may release similar features. Mitigation: emphasise the non‑custodial model, transparent performance and focus on reinforcement learning.
- **Execution Risk:** Recruiting and retaining specialised talent may be challenging. Mitigation: implement a competitive compensation plan and foster a strong company culture.
