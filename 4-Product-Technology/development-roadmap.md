![Development Roadmap Timeline](development-roadmap-timeline.png)

ReFi.Trading follows a four‑phase roadmap, each tied to clear business milestones:

## Phase 1 – Barebones Prototype (Q4 2025)

- Launch paper trading MVP with SnapTrade broker integration.
- Provide basic reinforcement learning agents and weekly retraining.
- Implement risk controls and value‑at‑risk limits.
- Goal: validate AI agents in simulation and reach 40 weekly active paper traders.

## Phase 2 – Identity & Compliance (Q1 2026)

- Integrate Sign‑In with Ethereum (EIP‑4361) for wallet authentication.
- Implement KYC/KYB onboarding via Chainlink CCID attestation.
- Use Chainlink ACE for compliance checks and caching via a compliance adapter.
- Prepare for live trading by achieving regulatory readiness.

## Phase 3 – Audit & ReFIN L2 Anchoring (Q2‑Q3 2026)

- Store trade and model performance proofs on a dedicated Layer 2 network.
- Anchor summaries on Ethereum L1 for tamper‑proof audit trails.
- Provide transparent dashboards for users and regulators.

## Phase 4 – On‑Chain Execution & DePIN (Q4 2026+)

- Enable on‑chain order execution through ReFIN L2.
- Tokenise assets and allow users to stake for compute resources.
- Expand to a decentralised physical infrastructure (DePIN) network for RL agents.
