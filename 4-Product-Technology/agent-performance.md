# Reinforcement Learning Agent Performance

![Agent Performance Chart](agent-performance-chart.png)

 - **Backtests:** A 3.1‑year walk‑forward benchmark (April 2022 – May 2025) produced a 28.1 % compound annual growth rate, a Sharpe ratio of 2.07 (95 % CI 1.00 – 3.16) and a maximum drawdown of 7.5 %. An equal‑weight buy‑and‑hold portfolio returned 13.8 % CAGR with a 0.65 Sharpe ratio and a 25 % drawdown. The strategy’s Expected‑Shortfall at the 99 % level is −2.8 %.
 - **Paper trading:** Early alpha users still report a win rate around 52 % in simulation mode with conservative risk caps. Future updates will incorporate risk‑adjusted metrics similar to the walk‑forward benchmark.
- **Risk controls:** Agents employ value‑at‑risk limits, maximum position sizes and progressive caps to reduce drawdown. Users can adjust risk parameters per agent.
