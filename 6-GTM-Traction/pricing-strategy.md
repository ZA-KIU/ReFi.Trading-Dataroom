# Pricing Strategy

During the alpha period paper trading is free. Once licensed the platform will adopt a tiered subscription model:

- **Basic:** US $99/month — includes one agent and basic features.
- **Pro:** US $299/month — includes up to five agents and advanced risk controls.
- **Enterprise:** US $999/month and up — custom agents, white‑label integrations and dedicated support.

Revenue projections assume conversion of a percentage of paper traders into paying subscribers over 12‑36 months.
