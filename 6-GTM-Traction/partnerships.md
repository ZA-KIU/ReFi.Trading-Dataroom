# Partnerships & Distribution

- **Brokers:** Engage Saxo Bank, Interactive Brokers, Alpaca and other brokers to offer seamless account connection. A white‑label partnership may serve as an interim licensing solution.
- **Influencers:** Partner with trusted trading educators and finfluencers to reach broader audiences.
- **Communities:** Collaborate with trading Discord servers, subreddits and online forums to promote the platform and recruit beta testers.

These partnerships will increase awareness, accelerate user acquisition and provide distribution channels beyond paid advertising.
