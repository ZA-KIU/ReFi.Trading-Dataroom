# User Acquisition Strategy

The growth strategy relies on organic content and community building:

- **Channels:** TikTok, Reddit, Twitter/X, LinkedIn and Discord are used to attract early adopters. YouTube and blog content provide deeper education.
- **Content:** Short‑form videos demonstrate the product, share trading tips and highlight the non‑custodial model. Long‑form articles explain reinforcement learning and risk management.
- **Influencers:** Collaborations with credible finfluencers to introduce the platform to larger audiences.
- **Community:** A Discord server serves as the central hub for user engagement, support and product feedback.
- **Conversion Funnel:** Users move from content to the website, sign up for alpha access, connect their broker and start paper trading.
