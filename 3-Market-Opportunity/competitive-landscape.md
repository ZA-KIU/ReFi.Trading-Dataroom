# Competitive Landscape

ReFi.Trading positions itself against both direct and indirect competitors:

- **TradingView, TradingView scripts:** Provide charting and alerts but no full automation or sophisticated RL models.
- **Robinhood bots, eToro bots:** Custodial platforms that lack transparency and customisation; strategies are simple momentum signals.
- **3Commas, Cryptohopper:** Offer algorithmic strategies but require users to deposit funds into their ecosystem.
- **Prop trading firms and hedge fund services:** Require high minimum capital and lock users into proprietary systems.

The company differentiates itself through a non‑custodial model, reinforcement learning agents, transparent performance and a compliance‑first approach.
