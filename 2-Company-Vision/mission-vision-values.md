# Mission, Vision and Values

## Mission

Provide retail traders and small funds with institutional‑grade trading infrastructure that automates execution, enforces risk controls and preserves user custody.

## Vision

By 2030 ReFi.Trading will serve as the backbone for decentralised algorithmic trading. The platform will evolve into the ReFIN Layer 2 network, allowing on‑chain execution of trades and transparent auditing of performance. Reinforcement learning agents will interact with multiple brokers and exchanges while users maintain full control of their assets.

## Values

- **Transparency:** Performance metrics and risk policies are visible to users and auditors.
- **Compliance‑First:** The company prioritises regulatory compliance and follows a clear licensing path.
- **User Control:** Users keep custody of their capital; the platform acts as an execution relay.
- **Continuous Learning:** Agents are retrained regularly; the team iterates based on data and user feedback.
