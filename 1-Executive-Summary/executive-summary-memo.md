# Executive Summary Memo

ReFi.Trading is building a non‑custodial trading platform that uses reinforcement learning to automate decision making for retail traders and small funds. The founding team consists of experienced technologists and fintech operators who understand the pain of manual trading and the need for transparent, compliant automation. The platform connects directly to users’ brokers via SnapTrade and runs agents in a paper trading environment until licensing is obtained. The company’s mission is to democratise institutional‑grade trading infrastructure while keeping user funds in the user’s own accounts.

The short‑term goal is to validate problem‑market fit by reaching 40 weekly active paper traders and converting at least 60 % of signups into broker‑connected users. Over the next six months the team will implement KYC and AML functionality, work towards a UAE (ADGM) Category 3A licence and explore white‑label partnerships with existing brokers to enable live trading. Long‑term, ReFi.Trading aims to build an on‑chain execution network (ReFIN L2) and a decentralised infrastructure for RL agents. This will allow the company to scale globally and unlock new revenue streams through staking and token economics.
