# One‑Pager (ReFi.Trading At‑A‑Glance)

## Problem

Power retail traders and small fund managers have the capital and skill to trade profitably but suffer from emotion, inconsistent execution, limited automation and lack of professional infrastructure. Manual trading or script‑based solutions consume time and lead to inconsistent results. Custodial bots and copy trading platforms force users to surrender control of their funds.

## Solution

ReFi.Trading offers non‑custodial reinforcement learning agents that connect directly to a user’s broker. The agents execute pre‑backtested strategies automatically and apply risk controls configured by the user. The platform provides transparent performance metrics and retains user control over capital at all times.
